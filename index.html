                                    Hestia's role in the IO-SEA project was/is to provide an efficient storage
                                    manipulation API, which provides an event feed of storage events allowing a "policy
                                    manager" (based on CEA's Robinhood engine) to manipulate data across the tiers
                                    exposed by Hestia. The policy manager will use the feed to ensure the data are in
                                    the optimal locations for user-end applications on target cluster.

                                    My initial focus in Hestia was in the DevOps of the project, overhauling this
                                    completely to provide a more robust continuous integration toolchain which fully
                                    utilizes Gitlab's CI toolkit and containerized workflows, and well as providing a
                                    new, automated testing and deployment workflow. Following this I implemented a first
                                    draft of Hestia's event feed, and presented this to stakeholders and collaborators
                                    for feedback. I helped in using this feedback to create the feature's second
                                    revision. Participated in the target-driven testing and review for delivering
                                    Hestia's first full release. Re-worked the CI system once more as the complexity of
                                    the project's needs grew into a re-usable and testable Python module for CI
                                    operations.

                                    Additionally, I took advantage of time provided by ICHEC to pursue development of my
                                    other skill sets by taking part in EuroCC-run workshops. Notable mentions include a
                                    multi-day workshop on the topic of distributed machine learning techniques in a HPC
                                    context and and introduction to the use of the ParaStation software suite.

                        <p>
                            Caelen joined <a href="https://par-tec.com/">Partec-AG</a> in November 2023 as a Software and 
                            Architecture Development Engineer. She works primarily in DevOps and integration of the
                            ParaStation Software suite with production systems.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Caelen joined <a href="https://www.ichec.ie/">ICHEC Dublin</a> in April 2023. At ICHEC, she
                            was involved in developing software for hierarchical storage management (HSM). She
                            participated in completing the <a href="https://iosea-project.eu/">IO-SEA</a> WP4
                            Deliverable 4.3,
                            working on the HSM API <a href="https://git.ichec.ie/io-sea-internal/hestia">Hestia</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prior to joining ICHEC, Caelen worked on research projects in HPC, mathematical modelling
                            (of EEG signals and PDEs), quantum computing, machine learning, and numerical computation of
                            complex functions. This research was conducted with EPCC/PRACE, Trinity College Dublin,
                            Equal1, Ausar Geophysical and TCD respectively between 2016 and 2022.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She completed her undergraduate degree with Trinity College Dublin in 2020. She enjoys
                            working on community outreach/educational projects, such as her work with the WEEArchie
                            Raspberry Pi HPC mini-cluster and several years of teaching extracurricular mathematics
                            classes on weekends for secondary school students in the Junior Mathematics Enrichment
                            Program of UCD. In the wake of these experiences, she is interested in establishing
                            solutions that allow for accessible and effective education a society dealing with the
                            impacts of COVID.

                            Caelen is an avid reader of fiction, enjoys board games and peaceful walks. She can juggle 3
                            objects quite well, and 4 quite poorly. She is currently learning the constructed language
                            Toki Pona, and re-learning Irish - má mhaith leat caint as Gaeilge leí.
